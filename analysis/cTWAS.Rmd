## Introduction

We have run the multigroup branch of [cTWAS](https://github.com/xinhe-lab/ctwas) on each cell type seperately. Three time points serve as the "group" for the cell type run.

eGenes for each condition (the combination of cell type and time point) was selected with two criteria: (1) At least one SNP-gene pair has FDR<0.05 in any time point within the same cell type; (2) P value < 0.1 for the current condition.
